# Not just a Figment of your Imagination

One of my favorite Disney characters doesn't come from a movie or show - he comes from a Walt Disney World ride.  He's a small purple dragon named Figment and you can find him in Epcot.  I recently was lucky enough to visit Disney World with my family and I was excited to go back on this ride.  We also had the chance to take a few magic shots that featured my favorite dragon as well.  PLUS, while we were visiting, the Epcot International Festial of the Arts started and Figment served as the mascot for the event.

I was so excited to see more Figment all throughout the park for the event.  So, were you already a Figment fan like me?
